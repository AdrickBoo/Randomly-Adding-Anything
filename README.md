# Randomly Adding Anything

## Why is this?
After a while, Minecraft's boundaries are massive. From surviving to fighting, from exploring to building to travelling across dimensions; Minecraft has many things and the only thing limiting you is your imagination.
However, once you learn it, it becomes kind of the same every time; always mine the same minerals, with always the same tools, always the same biomes.

This mod turns Minecraft back to that unexplored place that we once loved to learn to play and were afraid to explore!

## Features

### Randomize Ores!

When the mod is initially installed, it will create a new set of minerals and gems.
Each one of these ores are randomly colorized and generated.
These minerals can be found anywhere like sand or gravel, not only stone!
Each mineral has it's uses, and some are better than others in some situations.

## FAQ

#### Q: How do I re-randomize ores?
In the configs folder there is a `raa.json5` document. If you set the `"regen"` property to `true`, new ores will generate each time you boot up minecraft until that setting is turned back to `false`.
**TL;DR** Set `.minecraft/config/raa.json5`'s `"regen"` to `true` until you get whatever ores you like.
