# Randomly Adding Anything

## Why is this?
After a while, Minecraft's boundaries are massive. From surviving to fighting, from exploring to building to travelling across dimensions; Minecraft has many things and the only thing limiting you is your imagination.
However, once you learn it, it becomes kind of the same every time; always mine the same minerals, with always the same tools, always the same biomes.

This mod turns Minecraft back to that unexplored place that we once loved to learn to play and were afraid to explore!

## Features

### Randomize Ores!

Each time the world is generated, it will create a new set of minerals and gems to be mined, with different pros/cons for each tool or armor.
These minerals can be found anywhere, not only stone!
Each of these minerals have a random sprite and color.

## Planned Features

- Randomized effects for tools, weapons and armor.
- Randomly generated trees, plants with their own characteristics and woods.
- Random material information through Roughly Enough Items (REI)
- Automatic synchronization of materials files when connecting to a server.
